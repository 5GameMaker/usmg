                As a wasm game, obviously, this app requires JavaScript.
                I don't think you're even going to read this, but if you do
                and you use NoScript, you need to enable JavaScript and media
                <i>only</i> for the origin you're currently on. (assuming that we
                aren't going to host more servers on different origins in future.
                although, it's most likely never going to happen anyway.)

                Oh and if you're somehow are able to read this text, you're a real
                champion. Keep forcing websites to not use JavaScript for no good
                reason. No, really, why on Earth the simplest ever websites need
                JavaScript? This is perfectly reasonable for more complex websites
                with complex interations, but is completely unacceptable for a simple
                blog or a news website. Oh ye, this entire block is deleted by
                JavaScript, so you're not going to see it in devtools :)

                Wow, you've actually checked devtools! You're really enjoying yourself,
                aren't you? Very well, but now how about of a little game of whatever
                this game is named if I have figured out what to name this after all ;)
